# Scala Speedrun Guide

![Mdbook Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/mdbook-v0.4.32-brightgreen)

This is a compact guide to writing and especially understanding scala code based primarily on the materials of the Object Oriented and Functional Programming course taught at the VU.

## Recommendations and Disclaimers

- If you are a student taking OOFP then I recommend first and foremost you read the slides and go to the lectures, this is really only a cram guide
- The guide consists of alot of code snippets, if you wanna easily follow along checkout the [_scala cli_](https://scala-cli.virtuslab.org/) or you can also just use something like [_Scastie_](https://scastie.scala-lang.org/) to quickly run snippets.
- I am still a student as of writing this and these are not professional Notes by any means, just a collection of things that helped me, so keep that in mind, always double check and feel free to tell me if you spot any mistakes

## Description

The content is for the most part a copy of my [_exam practice notes_](https://applesauce-notes.notion.site/Quizzes-371775b8b03a4f3883ef292c7f21780f?pvs=4) based on the programming quizzes, but with this project I aimed to expand upon some things and overall improve the readability. As I am working on a few other things the progress for creating this might be slow so I welcome anyone who would want to contribute.
