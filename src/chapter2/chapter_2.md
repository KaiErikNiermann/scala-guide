# Chapter 2: Mutability and Purity

This chapter covers important datatsructures in scala, analysing the state of a program and finally pure and impure functions.

- [Lists and Arrays](./ListsAndArrays.md): This section explores the concepts of lists and arrays in scala. It explains how these data structures can be used to store and manipulate collections of elements. Additionally, it gives some examples for different types of lists and arrays, that is the different forms they can take on.

- [The Map Datastructure](./MapDatastruct.md): This section introduces the map data structure and its applications. It also gives some examples for when state is mutate using a Map and when not.

- [Analysing State](./mutabilityAnalysis.md): This section delves into the analysis of state in programming. That is it explores a method for understanding how state is mutated throughout the runtime of a specific program.

- [Pure and Impure functions](./PureAndImpure.md): This section explores the distinction between pure and impure functions. It explains how pure functions have no side effects and always produce the same output for a given input. On the other hand, impure functions may have side effects and can vary in their output.
