# Chapter 3: Advanced Functions

This chapter covers the syntax and application of advanced functions along with the concept of the placeholder in scala.

- [Syntax](./chapter3/FunctionSyntax.md): This section explores the features of type aliases in Scala, allowing developers to create custom type names for existing types. It covers parameterized types and function types, along with abstract type members and their implementation. The chapter also discusses confusing syntax involving aliased operators for list and set manipulation. Additionally, it highlights the versatility of the underscore symbol.

- [Placeholders and Partially applied functions](./chapter3/PlaceholdersAndPaFuncs.md): This section dives into the practical application of placeholders and partially applied functions in Scala. It presents various examples and options to handle computations involving multiset operations. The chapter explores different approaches, including options that are incorrect or invalid, and highlights the correct options along with their implementation. 

- [Composite functions and currying](./chapter3/CompositeFuncsAndCurrying.md): This section explores the concepts of composite functions and currying in Scala. It demonstrates how to create composite functions using the `andThen` function, combining multiple functions to form a new function. The chapter also delves into currying, showcasing how to convert regular functions into curried functions for enhanced flexibility and partial application. Additionally, the chapter touches on closures.

- [Miscallaneous](./chapter3/MiscContent.md): This section includes some additional content which I couldn't quite fit into the main sections but I nonetheless felt was at least somewhat useful.
